# Car Price Prediction ML Model

This project uses Machine Learning to predict the price of a car based on various features such as the car's brand, year, mileage, engine, and more. The model was built using Python and deployed with Streamlit for interactive predictions.

In the `Deployment Link` section, I included the link to your local deployment `http://localhost:8501/`. If you are deploying it on a cloud platform like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or any other, replace the local URL with the cloud deployment URL.
